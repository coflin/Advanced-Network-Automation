Introduction
Advanced Network Automation is designed to streamline network device configurations using Jinja2 templates and YAML files. The project incorporates tools like J2Lint for syntax checking, Containerlab for network simulation, and Jenkins for continuous integration, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce manual errors in network management.

Features
Jinja2 Templates: Facilitate dynamic and reusable network configurations.
YAML Configuration: Enable straightforward and human-readable configuration files.
Automated Syntax Checking: Utilize J2Lint to ensure template accuracy.
Network Simulation: Employ Containerlab for testing network topologies.
CI/CD Integration: Integrate with Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/coflin/Advanced-Network-Automation.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash

cd Advanced-Network-Automation
Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Configure YAML Files: Define your network device configurations in the configs/ directory.

Generate Configurations: Use the provided scripts to generate device configurations from Jinja2 templates and YAML files.

Validate Templates: Run J2Lint to check for syntax errors:

bash
Copy code
