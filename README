## Introduction

Advanced Network Automation is designed to streamline network device configurations using Jinja2 templates and YAML files. The project incorporates tools like J2Lint for syntax checking, Containerlab for network simulation, and Jenkins for continuous integration, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce manual errors in network management.

## Features

- **Jinja2 Templates**: Facilitate dynamic and reusable network configurations.
- **YAML Configuration**: Enable straightforward and human-readable configuration files.
- **Automated Syntax Checking**: Utilize J2Lint to ensure template accuracy.
- **Network Simulation**: Employ Containerlab for testing network topologies.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

## Installation
